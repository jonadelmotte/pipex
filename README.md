# PIPEX
<br />

## Description

creat a program that behave exactly like the following shell command : <br />
&emsp; `< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2`

### " < " symbol:

&emsp; The `<` symbol is an "input redirection" symbol. <br />
&emsp; In the `< file1 cmd1` shell command, `file1` becomes the new STDIN.  
&emsp; `cmd1` is not applied on the standart input anymore but on the content of `file1`.

### ">" symbol:

&emsp; The `>` symbol is an "output redirection" symbole. <br />
&emsp; In the `cmd2 > file2` shell command, `fil2` becomes the new STDOUT. <br />
&emsp; The result of `cmd2` is not stocked in the standart output anymore but in  the content of `file2`

### " | " symbol:

&emsp; the `|` (pipe) symbol redirects the output of the command on the left to the input of the command on the right. <br />
&emsp; In the `< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2` shell command, the output of `< file1 cmd1` <br />
&emsp; will be the new input of `cmd2 > file2`.  
<br />
## Instruction

first use the command `make` to creat the `pipex` executable.  
then use:  
&emsp; `./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2`  
replacing `file1` and `file2` with files.  
and replacing `cmd1` and `cmd2` with shell commands.
